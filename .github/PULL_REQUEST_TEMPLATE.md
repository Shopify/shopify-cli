### Update checklist

- [ ] I've added a CHANGELOG entry for this PR (if the change is public-facing)
- [ ] I've considered possible cross-platform impacts (Mac, Linux, Windows).
- [ ] I've left the version number as is (we'll handle incrementing this when releasing).
- [ ] I've included any post-release steps in the section above (if needed).
